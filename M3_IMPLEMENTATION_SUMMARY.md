## Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Models:** `Activity`, `LocationSample`, `Split`
- **Views:** `HistoryView`, `ActivityDetailView`, `ActivityRowView`
- **ViewModels:** `HistoryViewModel`, `ActivityDetailViewModel`
- **Repository:** `ActivityRepositoryProtocol` (existing)

### Dependency Injection
- ViewModels use `DependencyContainer` for service resolution
- Repository injected via protocol
- Testable design

### Reactive Programming
- Combine framework for state management
- `@Published` properties for UI binding
- Async/await for repository operations

### Navigation
- SwiftUI `NavigationStack` with `navigationPath`
- Sheet presentation for detail views
- Coordinator pattern (existing `HistoryCoordinator`)

---

## Code Quality

### Documentation
- Comprehensive inline comments
- MARK sections for organization
- Clear method and property documentation

### Error Handling
- Try/catch blocks for repository operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging via `Logger.shared`

### Testing Ready
- Protocol-based dependencies
- Repository pattern for data access
- Mockable services

### Performance
- Efficient list rendering with SwiftUI
- Lazy loading of activities
- Chart data calculated on-demand
- Memory-efficient location data handling

## Integration Points

### Existing Services Used
- ✅ `ActivityRepository` - CRUD operations for activities
- ✅ `UserDefaultsManager` - Distance unit preferences
- ✅ `Logger` - Structured logging
- ✅ `DependencyContainer` - Dependency injection
- ✅ `AppState` - Global app state

### Data Flow
1. User opens History tab
2. `HistoryViewModel` loads activities from `ActivityRepository`
3. Activities displayed in `HistoryView` using `ActivityRowView`
4. User taps activity → `ActivityDetailView` sheet presented
5. User can edit/delete → Changes saved via `ActivityRepository`
6. UI updates reactively via Combine publishers

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Create sample activities using Record tab
2. ✅ Verify activities appear in History tab
3. ✅ Test search functionality
4. ✅ Test all sort options
5. ✅ Test type filtering
6. ✅ Tap activity to view details
7. ✅ Verify all metrics display correctly
8. ✅ Test edit functionality
9. ✅ Test delete with confirmation
10. ✅ Test pull-to-refresh
11. ✅ Verify dark mode appearance
12. ✅ Test with 0, 1, and many activities

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for `HistoryViewModel`
- Unit tests for `ActivityDetailViewModel`
- UI tests for history navigation
- UI tests for detail view
- Performance tests with 100+ activities

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Route Map Display:** Uses basic MapKit integration. Full polyline rendering requires UIViewRepresentable (can be enhanced in future)
2. **Export:** Export button present but functionality deferred to M5
3. **Charts:** Basic line/area charts. Advanced analytics (comparison, trends) deferred to future milestones
4. **Edit:** Currently supports notes and type only. Additional fields (manual distance/time adjustment) can be added if needed
