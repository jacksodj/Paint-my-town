- Injected LocationServiceProtocol dependency
- Injected ActivityRepositoryProtocol dependency
- Injected AppState dependency

### M1-T11: Implement start/pause/resume/stop workflow ✅
- `startWorkout(type:)` - Creates ActiveWorkout, starts location tracking
- `pauseWorkout()` - Pauses workout, reduces GPS accuracy
- `resumeWorkout()` - Resumes workout, restores GPS accuracy
- `endWorkout()` - Stops workout, returns completed Activity
- `cancelWorkout()` - Cancels workout without saving
- State machine validation for all transitions
